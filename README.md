# Project Overview

**What is this project about?**  This project leverages real-world sensor data from a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) to predict net energy output (PE) using various environmental factors. The goal is to help optimize energy generation, enhance efficiency, and support sustainable resource management.

**Why is it important?** Energy production efficiency is crucial for reducing fuel consumption and lowering environmental impact. Predicting the power output allows plant operators to make better decisions, avoid under/overproduction, and reduce operational costs.

**So what?** By developing a robust machine learning model (XGBoost), we demonstrate how data science can directly support energy optimization, sustainability goals, and cost-effective production planning.

# Project Goal
To analyze the environmental and accurately predict the Net Energy Output (PE) of the power plant based on key environmental parameters such as:
- Ambient Temperature (AT)
- Exhaust Vacuum (V)
- Ambient Pressure (AP)
- Relative Humidity (RH)
The final model is expected to support energy production forecasting with relevant analysis, high accuracy and minimal error.
