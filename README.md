# Electrical Energy Forecasting on CCPP dataset Using Ensemble learning (XGBoost).
This project leverages the XGBoost regression algorithm to predict the net energy output (Power Output - PE) of a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) based on environmental factors. The goal is to optimize energy production by accurately modeling and understanding the relationship between operational conditions and power output.

## Introduction

Predicting full load electrical power output of a base load power plant is important in order to maximize the profit from the available megawatt hours. This examines and compares some machine learning regression 
methods to develop a predictive model, which can predict hourly full load electrical power output of a combined cycle power plant. The base load operation of a power plant is influenced by four main parameters, 
which are used as input variables in the dataset, such as ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and exhaust steam pressure. These parameters affect electrical power output, which is 
considered as the target variable. The dataset, which consists of these input and target variables, was collected over a six-year period. First, based on these variables the best subset of the dataset is explored 
among all feature subsets in the experiments. Then, the most successful machine learning regression method is sought for predicting full load electrical power output. 

In order for accurate system analysis with thermodynamical approaches, a high number of assumptions is necessary such that these assumptions account for the unpredictability in the solution. Without these 
assumptions, a thermodynamical analysis of a real application compels thousands of nonlinear equations, whose solution is either almost impossible or takes too much computational time and effort. To eliminate 
this barrier, the machine learning approaches are used mostly as alternative instead of thermodynamical approaches, in particular, to analyze the systems for arbitrary input and output patterns [1].
Predicting a real value, which is known as regression, is the most common problem researched in machine learning. For this reason, machine learning algorithms are used to control response of a system for 
predicting a numeric or real-valued target feature. Many real-life problems can be solved as regression problems, and evaluated using machine learning approaches to develop predictive models [2].
This paper deals with several machine learning regression methods for a prediction analysis of a thermodynamic system, which is a combined cycle power plant (CCPP) with two gas turbines, one steam turbine, and 
two heat recovery systems. Predicting electrical power output of a power plant has been considered a critical real-life problem to construct a model using machine learning techniques. To predict full load 
electrical power output of a base load power plant correctly is important for the efficiency and economic operation of a power plant. It is useful in order to maximize the income from the available megawatt hours 
(MW h). The reliability, and sustainability of a gas turbine depend highly on prediction of its power generation, particularly when it is subject to constraints of high profitability and contractual liabilities.

## System description
A combined cycle power plant is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators (HRSG). In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. A gas turbine in a combined cycle system does not only generate the electrical power but also generates fairly hot exhaust. Routing these gases through a water-cooled heat exchanger produces steam, which can be turned


## Problem Statement
The objective is to predict the net energy output (PE) of a power plant given environmental features:

 - Ambient Temperature (AT)
 - Exhaust Vacuum (V)
 - Ambient Pressure (AP)
 - Relative Humidity (RH). Accurate prediction of PE helps in optimizing power plant operations by balancing energy demands, improving efficiency, and reducing costs and environmental impacts.
